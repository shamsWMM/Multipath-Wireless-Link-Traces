Below is a description of the forked repo. To be modified to describe current repo.

This repo contains artifacts for reproducing our experiment on emulating multipath wireless scenarios on a networking testbed from the following pape:

Ilknur Aydin, Fraida Fund, Shivendra Panwar, _A Data Set and Reference Experiments for Multipath Wireless Emulation on Public Testbeds_, IEEE INFOCOM 2023 CNERT Worshop
https://infocom.info/workshops/track/CNERT

In particular, we provide the  
* the wireless (WiFi and Cellular) network link traces that were collected in the same time and place (see [Traces](Traces) folder)
* instructions and scripts to run the reference experiment that emulates a multipath wireless scenario by "playing back" the link traces in both CloudLab and FABRIC testbeds. (see [the witestlab blog](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/emulating-multipath-wireless/))
